# EmacsSetup
Files and instructions to duplicate my local Emacs setup.

Steps to set up.

- copy `.emacs` into your home directory, as a file named `.emacs`.

- open SeitiZenitaniDotEmacs in emacs. Run `M-x byte-compile-file`, and select this file when prompted. This will generate the file `SeijiZenitaniDotEmacs.elc`. Move this file to the directory ~/lib/emacs (create it if it doesn't already exist).


- Use Emacs!
